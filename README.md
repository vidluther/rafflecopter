## INSTRUCTIONS

Write an application in PHP using the Laravel framework, that has the functionality outlined below.

Keep it simple  -- no need for authentication. The estimated time to complete the assessment is 1 - 2 hours.

### Add Entry Form

The system must accept entries with the following required fields:

	* Full Name
	* Phone Number
	* Raffle Name (this should be a dropdown)

### View Entries

A county fair staff member wants to be able to see the complete list of entries. A simple list output or html table works here.

### Pick Winners

A county fair staff wants the system to be able to pick random winners for each raffle. The system must allow the staff to enter the total number of winners to be selected. For example, they may want to pick three winners for one raffle, and just one winner for another.
